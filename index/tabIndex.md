Number | Item | Link
------ | ---- | ----
tab01	| FPG ≥126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L). Fasting is defined as no caloric intake for at least 8 h. (OR) | 
tab02 | 2-h PG ≥200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) during an OGTT. The test should be performed as described by the WHO, using glucose load containing the equivalent of 75 g anhydrous glucose dissolved in water. (OR) |
tab03 | A1C ≥6.5% (48 mmol/mol). The test should be performed in a laboratory using a method that is NGSP certified and standardized to the DCCT assay. (OR) |
tab04 | In a patient with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis, a random plasma glucose ≥200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L). (OR) |
Notes | In the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia, results should be confirmed by repeat testing. |

------ | ---- | ----
tab05 | FPG 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) to 125 mg/dL (6.9 mmol/L) (OR) |
tab06 | 2-h PG in the 75-g OGTT 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) to 199 mg/dL (11.0 mmol/L) (OR) |
tab07 | A1C 5.7-6.4% (39247 mmol/mol) (OR) |
Notes | For all three tests, risk is continuous, extending below the lower limit of the range and becoming disproportionately greater at the higher end of the range. |
